Chapter 1 - Image Processing
======================================================
Image : 2D representation of digital values
Transform this 2D to following:
    - New representation (new image)
    - Decision (perform task)
    - Result (correct classification)
    - Extract useful information (object detection)

Image Processing Steps:
    1. Img-processing techniques to detect something
        - Low level process
            * Noise Removal
            * Image sharpening
            * Illumination normalization
            * Perspective correction
        - Mid level process
            * Representation of image like in vector (attributes) which summarize the information
            * Prepare for Feature representation and selection
        - High level process
            * Face recognition
            * Emotion recognition
            * Drowsiness and distraction detection
            * Remote heart rate measurement from the face
    2. Results of processing steps by showing box around the object
    3. Save the results

Image Formulation:
    Image can be described as 2D function f(x,y) where (x,y) are spatial coordinates.
    This f value is proportional to Brightness or Gray levels
    Digital image : When both (x,y) and f are all Finite discrete quantities
        x = height of image
        y = width of image
    Greyscale Image:
        One sample per pixel
        f(x,y) = [0,255] for 8-bit image
            0: dark and 255: light
    Color Image:
        Three samples per pixel
        fR(x,y) fG(x,y) fB(x,y) = [0,255] for 8*3=24 bit image
    B/W Image:
        One sample per pixel
        f(x,y) = {0,255} takes only 2 values gives 2-bit image
           0: black and 255: white
PS: 24 bit requires three times as much memory, disk space and processing time
    to store and manipulate 24-bit color images as compared to 8-bit color images.

Pixels: RGB model. Each color called as a channel.
    Image resolution 800 columns * 1200 rows = 960000 pixels
    But, its not the physical dimension of image.
    Physical dimension of image is depends on PPI pixels per inch.
    PPI = width(pixels) / width(inches)
    PPI = height(pixels) / height(inches)
    4 * 6 inches size of 800*1200 pixels image == 200 PPI
