FPS:
    FPS = 1.0/(process_stop_time - process_start_time)

Codecs:
    Codecs are used to uncompress the compressed video and vice versa.
    In OpenCV FOURCC - Four Character Code is used. It is platform
    dependant and hence needed to be installed in system before using
    them.

Video Capture Properties:
    Use cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH like properties from frame.
    capture.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_..... )

Video (encoding) Compressing and Saving:
    FourCC is a 4-byte code for video codec
    ex: XVID codec for .avi format file
        mp4v codec for .mp4 format file

PS: It is platform Dependent. So, confirm it, if not working.
