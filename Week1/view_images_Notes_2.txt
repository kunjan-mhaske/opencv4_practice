Playing with Colored and Grayscale Images:

OpenCV selected BGR color format instead of RGB because of popularity
of BGR at the time of openCV creation.

Matplotlib uses RGB color format and Matplotlib offers wide variety of
plotting images.

Hence, one should prefer the Matplotlib to show the images.

And Numpy to manipulate the Image matrix.
