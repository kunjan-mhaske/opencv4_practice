Give image and file names through command line arguments.
We can use sys.argv which is the list of arguments passed to
the command prompt.
sys.argv[0] = name of script
sys.argv[1] = first argument ..  and so on..

BUT,
we should handle the arguments using argparse library of python.
It gives user friendliness while coding and running the program.

    By default, webcam has camera index 0.
    cv2.VideoCapture(0) will capture the webcam feed.
